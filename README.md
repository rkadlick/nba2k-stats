# Project Title

Write the name of the project and one sentence about what it does and who it’s for.

## Overview

2–3 sentences on the problem this solves, who uses it, and the high-level outcome. Mention the current status (MVP/alpha/production) and any quick caveats.

## Features

Bullet a handful of marquee capabilities. Keep it short; emphasize what differentiates it. If something is planned but not shipped, note it as “planned.”

## Tech Stack

List the core technologies (framework, language, database, auth, styling). Call out anything non-obvious or version-sensitive that a reader should know.

## Setup

Explain prerequisites (Node version, package manager) and the minimal steps to install dependencies. Add a one-liner about repo cloning if needed.

## Environment Variables

List required env vars and what each is for. Mention where to find sample values (e.g., `.env.example`) and any gotchas (e.g., Supabase keys, auth domains).

## Running Locally

Describe the command to start the dev server and where to browse it. Add any first-run steps (seeding, migrations) the reader must do before it works.

## Supabase Setup

Give a quick pointer on creating the project, grabbing the anon URL/key, running the SQL schema/seed files, and adding initial users. Note where the full instructions live if longer.

## Project Structure

Describe the top-level folders and what lives in each (app, components, hooks, lib, supabase, public). Highlight any conventions for naming or organization.

## Usage

Outline the main flows: viewing stats, adding/editing games, switching views, managing playoffs/awards. Keep it high-level; you’ll fill in step-by-step notes here.

## Data Model

Summarize key tables/entities (players, games, seasons, awards, playoff series) and important relationships. Mention where the full schema can be found.

## Testing

State what tests exist (unit/e2e) and how to run them. If tests are light or pending, say so and note what should be covered next.

## Deployment

Explain how you deploy (platform, build command, env configuration). Call out any post-deploy tasks like running migrations or invalidating caches.

## Troubleshooting

List the most common failure modes (auth issues, missing env vars, Supabase connectivity) and quick checks to resolve them. Keep it concise.

## Roadmap

Add a short list of next priorities or nice-to-haves. Mark what’s in progress vs. planned.

## Contributing

State whether contributions are open or limited. If private, note who to contact; if open, give branch/PR guidelines briefly.

## License

Specify the license or note that it’s private/internal. Include any usage restrictions if applicable.
